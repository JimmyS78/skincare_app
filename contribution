Jimmy took the lead in setting up the initial project structure, including creating the Flask application (app.py), initializing the database (init_db.py),
and defining the Docker configuration (Dockerfile).
Meanwhile, Jihen focused on developing the frontend aspects, such as designing and implementing the HTML templates (templates directory) 
and styling the website with CSS and other static assets (static directory).
Both members actively participated in writing tests (test_app.py, test_e2e.py, test_integration.py) to ensure the application's functionality and reliability. 

  We worked together but decided to just upload the project at the end in github when we ensured that every thing is done. So one member has submitted the work.
